                            they traded draft picks to fortify their secondary with All-Pro Jamal Adams and starters
                            Quandre Diggs and Quinton Dunbar. Adams' return will not be enough; this defense will hold
                            the Seahawks back. Seattle's decision to largely ignore its pass-rushing needs this
                            offseason led to the team recording zero QB hits in a 70-minute game and squandering an
                            all-time NFL effort. Seattle finished 31st in sacks last season and has a worse group now.
                            Russell Wilson is the MVP frontrunner; the Seahawks cannot waste this form. They must be
                            prepared to part with more draft capital at the Nov. 3 trade deadline.</p>

                            unbeaten Titans in the first half, giving the Steelers an important cushion. Despite
                            Pittsburgh's latest find (Chase Claypool) going catchless, route-running maven Diontae
                            Johnson and ex-Brown sidekick JuJu Smith-Schuster combined for 18 receptions and 165 yards.
                            They fit well with post-elbow surgery Ben, who is not as eager to fire deep balls. The
                            Steelers' Brown-less (and largely Ben-less) offense ranked 32nd in DVOA last year.

                            whatever they wanted in the first half Sunday. Pittsburgh's final third-down line --
                            13-for-18 -- reveals an obvious issue for Tennessee (5-1). Though the Titans were on their
                            third game in 13 days, their defense has taken a step back this season -- despite getting
                            Malcolm Butler back and adding Jadeveon Clowney. They have allowed an NFL-worst 61%

                            out. In the strange position of vacillating between races for the No. 1 overall pick and a
                            division title, Washington (2-5) dominated Dallas and moved away from the Trevor Lawrence
                            pursuit for a bit. Cowboys QBs absorbed six sacks and fumbled thrice. Washington's 22 sacks
                            rank fourth in the NFL, with Montez Sweat now at five. Perhaps Washington should hold onto
                            contract-year Pro Bowler Ryan Kerrigan, despite its D-line surplus. The playoffs are somehow

                        <p class="card-text">The Falcons blasted Kenny Golladay after most of his six catches Sunday,
                            but the fourth-year wide receiver's toughness was essential to the Lions' comeback.
                            Detroit's top target smoked Atlanta's beleaguered but healthier secondary for 114 yards, and
                            the visitors' buzzer-beating escape would have been impossible had Golladay not snagged a
                            29-yard pass to allow the Lions (3-3) to avoid a Hail Mary scenario. With Amari Cooper and
                            Keenan Allen just signing $20 million-per-year deals, the Lions' 26-year-old WR1 will soon
                            surpass Calvin Johnson as the highest-paid wideout in franchise history.</p>

                            coach Raheem Morris will take a turn. The Falcons (1-6) held a 98% probability to beat the

                            Hockenson TD to seal what cannot be called a stunning loss. Already breaking margin-related
                            collapse records, the Falcons lost for a third time this season with a 98% win probability.
                            The rest of the NFL, per ESPN Stats and Info, has four combined such losses. Maybe back off
                            Todd Gurley? The Falcons still allowed a 75-yard game-winning drive after their back's

                            and was arguably at his 2020 best despite missing Michael Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders.
                            Judgment should be withheld until Brees' troops return. Having the Saints at 4-2 without

                            six-sack Bills effort to stonewall the NFL's worst team. Hughes registered two sacks, three
                            QB hits, forced a fumble and intercepted Darnold on a tipped pass. Those were the first

            <p class="lead my-3">The Patriots got steamrolled on Sunday when they lost 33-6 to the 49ers, and now
                they’ll be without a key depth piece moving forward. Linebacker Brandon Copeland told teammates he has a
                torn pec and is done for the season, a source told Mike Florio of ProFootballTalk.com (Twitter link).

                Copeland, signed to a cheap one-year deal back in March, is a core special teamer but has also been
                playing a real role on defense this year. He played a decent chunk of the defensive snaps in a few games
                and is credited with four starts. His 2020 season will conclude with 12 tackles, one for a loss.

                The Penn product signed with the Ravens as an undrafted free agent back in 2013, but he didn’t make his
                regular-season debut until 2015 with the Lions. After two years in Detroit as a special teamer he tore a
                pec in the 2017 preseason and signed with the Jets the following year, where he earned a big role on
                defense. In 16 games and 10 starts with New York in 2018, he racked up five sacks, two passes defended
                and eight tackles for loss.</p>

                    Auburn on Saturday.
                    Kiffin was angry about a key officiating error that was not reviewed during the fourth quarter of
                    Saturday’s defeat. On Monday, Kiffin spoke to SEC head of officiating John McDaid, and the
                    conversation did not seem to go well. Kiffin said he was “not allowed” to say anything about the
                    conversation and added that he was told “there’s a policy.”</p>

                <h2>NFL Quiz</h2>
                <p>\On Sunday, 43-year-old Tom Brady looked like the Tom Brady of old. In a 45-20 trouncing of the Las
                    Vegas Raiders, Brady threw for 369 yards and four touchdowns. The fourth TD gave him sole possession
                    of the NFL record for most TD passes, at least temporarily. The man he passed, Drew Brees, is still
                    very much active and had two scores himself in Week 7. With this likely being Brees' final year in
                    the league, and Brady on record saying that he wants to play until he is 45, the record should
                    ultimately be Brady's. Don't be surprised if the two legendary signal-callers pass the record back
                    and forth in 2020 though.</p>

                    15 yards in the Bears' November 2019 loss to the Rams. New Rams defensive coordinator Brandon Staley
                    is moving his top cover man around formations this year, so he will see plenty of Robinson. The
                    Bears (5-1) have targeted Robinson 66 times (fifth-most entering Week 7) this season, but Ramsey's
                    presence will increase the need for auxiliary targets Anthony Miller and Darnell Mooney (56 combined
                    targets) to show up for Nick Foles. </p>

                    <p class="lead">Rising through the NFL coaching ranks at a speed that somewhat rivals
                    current boss Sean McVay, Staley has gone from Bears outside linebackers coach -- under Matt Nagy --
                    to Rams defensive coordinator in two years. (And his in-between stop only featured the "Broncos OLBs
                    coach" title.) The Vic Fangio disciple has the Rams (4-2) ranking third in scoring defense, though a
                    key caveat exists. The Rams' four wins have come over the NFC East. While the Bears have questions
                    of their own (a plus-12 point differential), Staley's unit -- which also features ex-Bears
                    first-round pick Leonard Floyd -- should not be viewed as reliable just yet.</p>

                <p class="lead">Hours after Thursday night's collapse, the Giants traded edge rusher Markus Golden. The
                    team that dealt away Jerry Reese-era investments Eli Apple and Snacks Harrison (in-season) and Odell
                    Beckham Jr., Jason Pierre-Paul and Oliver Vernon (offseason) should be viewed as an active seller.
                    Golden Tate looms as an obvious trade chip, but Evan Engram and guard Kevin Zeitler would probably
                    fetch better draft capital. Engram's status as a Reese draftee at a scarcer position (tight end)
                    makes him a player to watch ahead of the Nov. 3 deadline. Both Engram and Zeitler are signed through
                    2021.</p>
